#I downloaded a database and familiarized myself with the data by visualizing how the tables are related and determined what I wanted to know from the dataset.
#Then, I answered them using SQL.

#1. All customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US
SELECT customerid
, firstname
, lastname
, country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country <> "United States";

#2. Show only customers from brazil
SELECT *
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country="Brazil";

#3. Find all invoices of customers from Brazil including the customer's full name, invoice id, date of the invoice, and billing country
SELECT cstm.firstname
, cstm.lastname
, inv.invoicedate
, inv.invoiceid
, inv.billingcountry
FROM chinook.invoices as inv
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers as cstm
ON cstm.customerid=inv.customerid
WHERE billingcountry='Brazil';

#4. Show the employees who are Sales Agents
SELECT *
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE title like 'Sales%Agent';

#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the invoice table
SELECT distinct billingcountry
FROM chinook.invoices;

#6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. the resulting table should include the agent's full name
SELECT emp.lastname, emp.firstname, inv.invoiceid
FROM chinook.employees emp
JOIN chinook.customers cstm ON cstm.supportrepid=emp.employeeid
JOIN chinook.invoices inv ON inv.customerid=cstm.customerid;

#7. Show the invoice total, customer name, country, and sales agent name for all invoices and customers
SELECT cstm.firstname
, cstm.lastname
, inv.billingcountry
, emp.firstname
, emp.lastname
, inv.total
FROM chinook.employees emp
JOIN chinook.customers cstm ON cstm.supportrepid=emp.employeeid
JOIN chinook.invoices inv ON inv.customerid=cstm.customerid;

#8. How many invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT count(*)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE invoicedate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#9. What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT sum(total)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE invoicedate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID
SELECT t.name, i.invoicelineid
FROM chinook.invoice_items i
JOIN chinook.tracks t ON i.trackid=t.trackid;

#11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID
SELECT art.name as artist
, t.name as track
, inv.invoicelineid
FROM chinook.invoice_items inv
LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks t ON t.trackid=inv.trackid
INNER JOIN chinook.albums alb ON alb.albumid=t.albumid
LEFT JOIN chinook.artists art ON art.artistid=alb.artistid;

#12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre
SELECT trk.name as track_name
, alb.title as album_name

, gen.name as genre
FROM chinook.tracks trk
JOIN chinook.albums alb ON alb.albumid=trk.albumid
JOIN chinook.media_types med ON med.mediatypeid=trk.mediatypeid
JOIN chinook.genres gen ON gen.genreid=trk.genreid;

#13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent
SELECT emp.firstname
, emp.lastname
, ROUND (sum(inv.total), 2) AS 'Total Sales'
FROM chinook.employees emp
JOIN chinook.customers cstm ON cstm.supportrepid=emp.employeeid
JOIN chinook.invoices inv ON inv.customerid=cstm.customerid
WHERE emp.title = 'Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY emp.firstname;

#14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
SELECT emp.firstname
, emp.lastname

JOIN chinook.invoices inv ON inv.customerid=cstm.customerid
WHERE emp.title='Sales Support Agent'
AND inv.invoicedate like '2009%'
GROUP BY emp.firstname
ORDER BY (round(sum(inv.total), 2))
DESC LIMIT 1;

#15.
#16. 
#17.
